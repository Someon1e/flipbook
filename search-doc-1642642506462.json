As such, to migrate over from Hoarcekat the first thing you should do is create a storybook for your project. To do this, create a new ProjectName.storybook.lua file at the root of your project with the following contents: -- Make sure to adjust the path to Roact if needed local Roact = require(script.Parent.Parent.Roact) return { roact = Roact, storyRoots = { script.Parent.Components } } Copy From there the storybook will appear in flipbook's sidebar and you should be able to select your stories with no problem. "},{"title":"Migrating Stories​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Migrating from Hoarcekat","url":"docs/migrating#migrating-stories","content":"To fully benefit from the features flipbook has to offer, this section will guide you in converting an existing Hoarcekat story to flipbook's format. We will use the following component and story as an example: -- HelloWorld.lua type Props = { name: string? } local function HelloWorld(props: Props) local name = props.name or &quot;World&quot; return Roact.createElement(&quot;TextLabel&quot;, { Text = (&quot;Hello %s!&quot;):format(name), TextColor3 = Color3.fromRGB(0, 0, 0), TextScaled = true, Font = Enum.Font.GothamBold, Size = UDim2.fromOffset(200, 100), BackgroundColor3 = Color3.fromRGB(255, 255, 255), }) end return HelloWorld Copy -- HelloWorld.story.lua local Roact = require(script.Parent.Parent.Roact) local HelloWorld = require(script.Parent.HelloWorld) return function(target) local root = Roact.createElement(HelloWorld, { name = &quot;flipbook&quot; }) local handle = Roact.mount(root, target) return function() Roact.unmount(handle) end end Copy Converting a Hoarcekat story like this into one compatible with flipbook is quite easy. In fact, all that's needed from the above story is the call to Roact.createElement: -- HelloWorld.story.lua local Roact = require(script.Parent.Parent.Roact) local HelloWorld = require(script.Parent.HelloWorld) return { story = Roact.createElement(HelloWorld, { name = &quot;flipbook&quot; }) } Copy Since flipbook assumes use of Roact, you don't have to handle mounting and unmounting yourself. And now that the story has been migrated we can start supercharging it. For starters, we can give the story a summary that will be displayed when viewing it: local Roact = require(script.Parent.Parent.Roact) local HelloWorld = require(script.Parent.HelloWorld) return { + summary = &quot;This is a Hoarcekat component that has been converted for flipbook!&quot; story = Roact.createElement(HelloWorld, { name = &quot;flipbook&quot; }) } Copy Next lets add some controls so we can change the name prop without having to manually modify the story: local Roact = require(script.Parent.Parent.Roact) local HelloWorld = require(script.Parent.HelloWorld) return { summary = &quot;This is a Hoarcekat component that has been converted for flipbook!&quot; + controls = { + name = &quot;flipbook&quot; + } + story = return function(props) + return Roact.createElement(HelloWorld, { + name = props.controls.name + }) + end } Copy You will now have a &quot;Controls&quot; section with an input field. Try changing the value to see your component update live. You are now equipped to migrate your other Hoarcekat stories over to flipbook!

Right now you should see a single entry in flipbook's sidebar for this storybook. Let's add a story to liven things up! "},{"title":"Story​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Writing Stories","url":"docs/writing-stories#story","content":"A story and its associated component should be in two separate files. Both files should share the same name, however the story will end with .story. To get started, let's create Button.lua and Button.story.lua: -- src/Components/Button.lua local Roact = require(path.to.Roact) type Props = { text: string, onActivated: (() -&gt; ())?, } local function Button(props) return Roact.createElement(&quot;TextButton&quot;, { Text = props.text, TextSize = 16, Font = Enum.Font.GothamBold, TextColor3 = Color3.fromRGB(255, 255, 255), BackgroundColor3 = Color3.fromRGB(239, 31, 90), BorderSizePixel = 0, AutomaticSize = Enum.AutomaticSize.XY, [Roact.Event.Activated] = props.onActivated, }, { Padding = Roact.createElement(&quot;UIPadding&quot;, { PaddingTop = UDim.new(0, 8), PaddingRight = UDim.new(0, 8), PaddingBottom = UDim.new(0, 8), PaddingLeft = UDim.new(0, 8), }), }) end return Button Copy And now let's write the story to mount the Button component: -- src/Components/Button.story.lua local Roact = require(path.to.Roact) local Button = require(script.Parent.Button) return { summary = &quot;A generic button component that can be used anywhere&quot;, story = Roact.createElement(Button, { text = &quot;Click me&quot;, onActivated = function() print(&quot;click&quot;) end, }), } Copy In the sidebar for flipbook you should now see your newly created Button story. Go ahead and select it to view the button you just created. Writing stories can significantly improve your experience while developing Roact components.It's recommended that you create a story for each component so that you work on them in isolation to build up a strong foundation for your app. "},{"title":"Controls​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Writing Stories","url":"docs/writing-stories#controls","content":"flipbook also has the feature of &quot;controls&quot; where you can specify configurable values that get passed down into your component. We will continue with our Button component and give it a &quot;disabled&quot; state for when we don't want a user to be able to interact with it: type Props = { text: string, + isDisabled: boolean?, onActivated: (() -&gt; ())?, } local function Button(props) + local color = if props.isDisabled then Color3.fromRGB(82, 82, 82) else Color3.fromRGB(239, 31, 90) return Roact.createElement(&quot;TextButton&quot;, { Text = props.text, TextSize = 16, Font = Enum.Font.GothamBold, TextColor3 = Color3.fromRGB(255, 255, 255), - BackgroundColor3 = Color3.fromRGB(239, 31, 90), + BackgroundColor3 = color, BorderSizePixel = 0, AutomaticSize = Enum.AutomaticSize.XY, - [Roact.Event.Activated] = props.onActivated, + [Roact.Event.Activated] = if props.isDisabled then nil else props.onActivated, }, { Padding = Roact.createElement(&quot;UIPadding&quot;, { PaddingTop = UDim.new(0, 8), PaddingRight = UDim.new(0, 8), PaddingBottom = UDim.new(0, 8), PaddingLeft = UDim.new(0, 8), }), }) end return Button Copy And now modify the story to pass in the isDisabled prop: local Roact = require(path.to.Roact) local Button = require(script.Parent.Button) return { summary = &quot;A generic button component that can be used anywhere&quot;, story = Roact.createElement(Button, { text = &quot;Click me&quot;, + isDisabled = true, onActivated = function() print(&quot;click&quot;) end, }), } Copy The story should automatically reload and you will see the button is greyed out and no longed prints &quot;click&quot; when activated. Despite this new isDisabled prop, it is still hard to test out different state sfor the button since you have to manually edit the story each time. That's where controls come in. Modify your story as follows: local Roact = require(path.to.Roact) local Button = require(script.Parent.Button) return { summary = &quot;A generic button component that can be used anywhere&quot;, + controls = { + isDisabled = false, + }, - story = Roact.createElement(Button, { + story = function(props) + return Roact.createElement(Button, { text = &quot;Click me&quot;, - isDisabled = true, + isDisabled = props.controls.isDisabled, onActivated = function() print(&quot;click&quot;) end, }) + end, } Copy With this change, a new &quot;Controls&quot; panel will appear where you can toggle the isDisabled prop. This gets fed into your Button component and will automatically reload. You can now toggle between your button's states to see how it behaves.
